# Changelog

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-10

- Add the embeddable Tasks TUI package used by Sidecar, including host-owned
  command routing, shortcut metadata, theme projection, queue/context hooks,
  and independently configurable chrome.
- Migrate the standalone TUI to Bubble Tea v2 while preserving shared behavior
  between the embedded and standalone surfaces.
- Harden embedded key routing, modal bindings, exported command invocation,
  and quit handling so host applications can safely compose Tasks with their
  own controls.
- Restore nested, tree-aware project rendering and add confirmed hard-delete
  with undo support.
- Add provenance-aware local installation and Homebrew switching commands for
  reliable development and consumer testing.
- Supersede the unpublished `v1.1.0`, `v1.2.0`, and `v1.3.0` tags, whose
  release workflows failed before publishing artifacts.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-04

- Make the completed Go CLI, TUI, API, store, journal, and merge driver the
  sole implementation on `main`.
- Preserve the final Ruby-containing tree as annotated tag
  `ruby-final-2026-08-04`.
- Add standalone versioning, safe explicit configuration, Homebrew packaging,
  guarded releases, and Darwin/Linux archives for arm64 and amd64.
